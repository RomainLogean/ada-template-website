title: "The biases behind rating: Uncovering the hidden influences in beer ratings"
description: >
  The main goal of every rating app is to show an objective rating for various objects, which in our case are beers. 
  As each beer receives a lot of reviews from different users, the mean rate of each beer should be quite representative. 
  However, every rate is given by a human, and humans are not objective creatures; they might be influenced by several biases. 
  If the majority of users are subject to the same bias, then the final rate can be significantly impacted. 
  In this project, we want to analyze various biases, such as trends, cultural bias, or naming bias, in the beer reviews’ dataset 
  and see how they influence the rating. Knowing how people are influenced can help us to adjust the rating in order to get more 
  objective and accurate ratings.
